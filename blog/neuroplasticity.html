                of neuroplasticity benefits people</h2>
              <p>Understanding neuroplasticity can be simplified to the basic
                concept that the brain is a dynamic and responsive
                organ that is constantly capable of change. Learning that each
                thought changes the structure and function of
                your brain by affecting the neurons at the microscopic level,
                empowers people to be more aware of how their time
                is spent and its impact. <br><br>“The world I create is
                always creating me back.” <br><br>With continuous stimulus (e.g.
                an
                emotion, a feeling, a
                behavior, a habit, an exercise, an experience), the
                repetition of the stimulus will cause neurogenesis (the creation
                of new neurons). It is useful to understand
                this process of learning in relationship with synaptic pruning,
                the process by which the neurons lose synapses
                and surface area through underuse. In simple terms, we
                have the
                power to make thought processes stronger and
                easier to access, or weaker and less intrusive.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
              <h2 class="sub-heading">Discuss how you might engage with the
                principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit</h2>
              <p>
                A takeaway for me from the resource linked below, was that
                practicing meditation and mindfulness will increase
                the size of the prefrontal cortex, whereas excess stress will
                shrink it. As this part of the brain is the key to
                problem solving, creativity, impulse control and perseverance,
                among other important skills, it is easy to
                justify the importance of mindfulness practices. <br><br>I can
                also
                understand that having a deeper understanding of my
                brain and its fluidity, will allow me to have increased empathy
                for myself and others. The concept of synaptic
                pruning is a good reminder that I need to be practicing positive
                habits regularly in order for the process to
                embed. Conversely, learning about neuroplasticity makes me aware
                that the more I allow myself to experience
                negative self-talk and other unproductive emotions, the easier
                those thoughts are to access.

              <h2 class="sub-heading">What are some of the ways to increase your
                neuroplasticity?</h2>
              <p>
                Repeatedly practicing an activity or accessing a memory will
                cause neural networks (groups of neurons that fire
                together) to create electrochemical pathways. This means they
                will shape themselves according to that activity
                or memory. <br><br>Also, performing tasks or recalling
                information
                that causes different neurons to fire in concert, it
                will strengthen the connections between those cells. For
                example, learning a new skill that relates to previous
                life experience or skills that have already been practiced
                long-term.

              <h2 class="sub-heading">Discuss what a growth mindset is and why
                it is relevant</h2>
              <p>
                A growth mindset describes the extent to which individuals
                believe they can change and grow. That is, someone
                with a growth mindset believes that something they cannot
                achieve today, may be achievable tomorrow. <br><br>It is
                relevant because it dictates a person's willingness to take on
                challenges and new experiences. Someone with a
                growth mindset is more likely to step outside of their comfort
                zone, as they understand that perseverance is
                more valuable in the long run than a standalone result of a
                singular challenge. They will also be more motivated
                to dedicate time and make sacrifices to benefit performance in
                the future, as well as to help others grow. With
                a growth mindset, higher self esteem can be achieved by allowing
                oneself room to improve, to make mistakes and
                to learn from failures.

              <h2 class="sub-heading">In this exploration, did anything surprise
                you? Change for you?</h2>
              <p>
                I was surprised to find a resource that focussed on moving
                towards having a growth mindset from a place of anger
                and shame. These are my most paralysing emotions and my most
                difficult headspace to move past and out of. Some
                areas of mental health resources focus more on plans of action
                than starting context. While this makes these
                resources more widely accessible to a broader audience, I find
                it very useful to learn from personal experience
                that feels specific and relatable.</p>
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
              <h2 class="sub-heading">How will you integrate growth mindset into
                your learning journey?</h2>
              <p>Through reflecting on my successes and failures, I can have a
                bigger picture perspective on my abilities and
                therefore, my growth. By avoiding giving my selective memory the
                power to shape my view of myself and my skills,
                I can reduce the impact of individual experiences on my big
                picture perspective. Instead, singular experiences
                can become building blocks, whose role played in my progression
                is more important than their standalone result.
                I want to avoid having tunnel vision in cases of both success
                and failure and see them as part of a larger
                journey. <br><br>“Wins and losses are merely markers in our own
                stories
                of personal development.”

              <p>Understanding that my brain is adaptable, always changing and
                directly affected by repeated thought processes,
                will increase my motivation to practice positive routines in
                order to build habits. Something I emphasised in my
                learning plan is that I struggle to take breaks in order to step
                away from difficult problems so that I can come
                back to them with a refreshed take. Knowing that commitment to
                this goal will make it easier in the long run to
                operate more efficiently will help me conduct myself with
                initiative in regards to this.</p>
