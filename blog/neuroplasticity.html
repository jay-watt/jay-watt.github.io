        Neuroplasticity
      </h2>
      <h3>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.
      </h3>
      <p>
        Understanding neuroplasticity can be simplified to the basic concept that the brain is a dynamic and responsive
        organ that is constantly capable of change. Learning that each thought changes the structure and function of
        your brain by affecting the neurons at the microscopic level, empowers people to be more aware of how their time
        is spent and its impact.
        “The world I create is always creating me back.”
        With continuous stimulus (e.g. an emotion, a feeling, a behavior, a habit, an exercise, an experience), the
        repetition of the stimulus will cause neurogenesis (the creation of new neurons). It is useful to understand
        this process of learning in relationship with synaptic pruning, the process by which the neurons lose synapses
        and surface area through underuse. In simple terms, we have the power to make thought processes stronger and
        easier to access, or weaker and less intrusive.

      <h3>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.
      </h3>
      <p>
        A takeaway for me from the resource linked below, was that practicing meditation and mindfulness will increase
        the size of the prefrontal cortex, whereas excess stress will shrink it. As this part of the brain is the key to
        problem solving, creativity, impulse control and perseverance, among other important skills, it is easy to
        justify the importance of mindfulness practices. I can also understand that having a deeper understanding of my
        brain and its fluidity, will allow me to have increased empathy for myself and others. The concept of synaptic
        pruning is a good reminder that I need to be practicing positive habits regularly in order for the process to
        embed. Conversely, learning about neuroplasticity makes me aware that the more I allow myself to experience
        negative self-talk and other unproductive emotions, the easier those thoughts are to access.

      <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Repeatedly practicing an activity or accessing a memory will cause neural networks (groups of neurons that fire
        together) to create electrochemical pathways. This means they will shape themselves according to that activity
        or memory. Also, performing tasks or recalling information that causes different neurons to fire in concert, it
        will strengthen the connections between those cells. For example, learning a new skill that relates to previous
        life experience or skills that have already been practiced long-term.

      <h2>
        Growth mindset
      </h2>
      <h3>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.
      </h3>
      <p>
        A growth mindset describes the extent to which individuals believe they can change and grow. That is, someone
        with a growth mindset believes that something they cannot achieve today, may be achievable tomorrow. It is
        relevant because it dictates a person's willingness to take on challenges and new experiences. Someone with a
        growth mindset is more likely to step outside of their comfort zone, as they understand that perseverance is
        more valuable in the long run than a standalone result of a singular challenge. They will also be more motivated
        to dedicate time and make sacrifices to benefit performance in the future, as well as to help others grow. With
        a growth mindset, higher self esteem can be achieved by allowing oneself room to improve, to make mistakes and
        to learn from failures.

      <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I was surprised to find a resource that focussed on moving towards having a growth mindset from a place of anger
        and shame. These are my most paralysing emotions and my most difficult headspace to move past and out of. Some
        areas of mental health resources focus more on plans of action than starting context. While this makes these
        resources more widely accessible to a broader audience, I find it very useful to learn from personal experience
        that feels specific and relatable.

      <h3>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Through reflecting on my successes and failures, I can have a bigger picture perspective on my abilities and
        therefore, my growth. By avoiding giving my selective memory the power to shape my view of myself and my skills,
        I can reduce the impact of individual experiences on my big picture perspective. Instead, singular experiences
        can become building blocks, whose role played in my progression is more important than their standalone result.
        I want to avoid having tunnel vision in cases of both success and failure and see them as part of a larger
        journey. “Wins and losses are merely markers in our own stories of personal development.”

        Learning plan
      </h2>
      <h3>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.
      </h3>
      <p>
        Understanding that my brain is adaptable, always changing and directly affected by repeated thought processes,
        will increase my motivation to practice positive routines in order to build habits. Something I emphasised in my
        learning plan is that I struggle to take breaks in order to step away from difficult problems so that I can come
        back to them with a refreshed take. Knowing that commitment to this goal will make it easier in the long run to
        operate more efficiently will help me conduct myself with initiative in regards to this.
