    <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
    <div>
      <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
      <p>I would like to work freelance on projects that I am invested in. At the moment, there are two main areas I
        would like to aim towards working in. One is sustainable waste management. Some apps/websites that are lacking
        in this sector focus on goals like public education, creating connections between people with waste and
        community members with recycling solutions, waste worker job assistance, etc. The other area would be Pasifika
        knowledge access, specifically Fijian language and culture. There is a lack of well-designed apps and websites I
        have found to research my culture. While the most important way is engaging with the elders I have around me, I
        feel strongly about there being other routes to connection, particularly for those in the diaspora.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning.</h2>
      <p>My major strength in learning is creative problem solving. Many of the skills I have and cherish today were
        learnt outside of formal learning environments and I recognise that valuable knowledge can often be found in
        unexpected places. I have also always enjoyed working and collaborating in DIY environments, and pride myself on
        being resourceful. My biggest limitation is getting stuck and struggling to move on. It has been helpful to get
        into the habit of using a pomodoro break timer but I will need to keep it up long term in order to retain
        meaningful changes. Another difficulty I have is balancing my learning with my other obligations. My priority,
        whether I am studying or working, is always my family. They are consistently supportive and understanding of my
        other commitments, but I often struggle to acknowledge my limited capacity when I have demanding workloads.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev
        Academy?</h2>
      <p>I recognise the importance of reflecting throughout project work and learning. I would like to practise this
        more throughout my time at DA so that I can identify the areas that are useful for me to reflect on. By the end
        of the course, I want to have a clear set of questions that are productive for me to ask myself while learning.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h2>
      <p>I will take initiative in making sure I am resting and maintaining a healthy study-life balance. This will
        allow me to communicate more effectively, as well as increasing my patience when working with others. Managing
        my stress through adequate rest and therapy helps me to be a better listener which is, in my opinion, the most
        important part of collaborating. I will also push myself to reach out for help among the team at DA which will
        alleviate isolation and helplessness.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h2>
      <p>I will make sure that I have contact details and times available for the appropriate DA staff throughout this
        course. Consistent therapy is something I will endeavor to keep up, as well as attending a support group I have
        been a part of long-term. Keeping my flatmates at home in the loop will also widen my network of available
        support when I need it.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team.</h2>
      <p>I expect to be listened to without assumptions being made, or expectations put on me to explain and educate
        beyond my capacity.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</h2>
      <p>I have a fortnightly hourly appointment that I am hoping to shift to lunchtime for bootcamp. If not, I will fit
        it in over the weekend. Otherwise, I have no set obligations that will interfere with the set bootcamp schedule.
