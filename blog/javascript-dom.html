  <h1>JavaScript & DOM</h1>
  <div>
    <h2>
      An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      HTML, CSS and JavaScript are three different types of files that are used
      together as a team, to build a website. Using the analogy of a kitchen,
      the HTML provides the inventory of ingredients, cookware and appliances.
      The CSS is the design, whether the kitchen has stainless steel
      benchtops, or bright red pots and pans. To provide function to the HTML
      elements, the JavaScript is the book of recipes, showing any user of the
      kitchen how to put the ingredients, cookware and appliances together to
      create tasty results. JavaScript can also change the CSS, for example,
      if the user is cooking for a large number, the JavaScript can edit the
      CSS to make the pots and pans bigger.

    <h2>
      Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday
      life.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Control flow is the order in which the computer reads code and executes
      statements in a script. In simple terms, it is similar to how I make my
      morning coffee. There is an order I follow starting with putting the
      coffee in the plunger, followed by the water, then allowing a brew time,
      then plunging. It is like an if…else loop, which first checks whether I
      have 1. had a coffee and 2. have time to make one. If both of these
      conditions are satisfied, i.e. I haven’t had a coffee and I do have time
      to make one, I enter the coffee loop and must go through all the steps
      listed above before moving on to other tasks.

    <h2>
      Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with
      it.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The DOM is a tree-like representation of the web page that gets loaded
      into the browser. Through this structure, the user can access and change
      elements in a webpage. Similar to a family tree, each element has a
      parent element, with the exception of the starting node of the tree.
      Like an actual tree, interaction with the DOM allows cutting off
      branches and leaves, as well as growing new branches and leaves. The
      user can also modify the entire tree by changing the trunk. In terms of
      DOM interaction, changing the trunk would translate to editing the main
      parent HTML window node, for example, changing the background colour of
      the entire webpage.

    <h2>
      Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Arrays and objects are two ways to store data in a group. In arrays, the
      order is the most important factor for organising information. This is
      similar to a fiction book that is split up between chapters where the
      chapters must be read in order for the story to make sense. However,
      objects store data according to keys or labels. This makes objects more
      similar to encyclopedias or nonfiction books where the reader will most
      likely skip to sections containing relevant information.

    <h2>Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.</h2>
    <p>
      Explain what functions are and why they are helpful. Functions are sets
      of steps taken in order to perform a task. They are helpful in making
      code more concise as processes that are used multiple times can be laid
      out in one function and called on using simply the function name. This
      is similar to having a large water bottle that will last the day as
      opposed to a small glass that must be refilled each time I drink water.
