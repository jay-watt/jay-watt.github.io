                relationship to HTML and CSS</h2>
              <p>
                HTML, CSS and JavaScript are three different types of files that
                are used
                together as a team, to build a website. Using the analogy of a
                kitchen,
                the HTML provides the inventory of ingredients, cookware and
                appliances.
                The CSS is the design, whether the kitchen has stainless steel
                benchtops, or bright red pots and pans. To provide function to
                the HTML
                elements, the JavaScript is the book of recipes, showing any
                user of the
                kitchen how to put the ingredients, cookware and appliances
                together to
                create tasty results. JavaScript can also change the CSS, for
                example,
                if the user is cooking for a large number, the JavaScript can
                edit the
                CSS to make the pots and pans bigger.

                example process from everyday
                life</h2>
              <p>
                Control flow is the order in which the computer reads code and
                executes
                statements in a script. In simple terms, it is similar to how I
                make my
                morning coffee. There is an order I follow starting with putting
                the
                coffee in the plunger, followed by the water, then allowing a
                brew time,
                then plunging. It is like an if…else loop, which first checks
                whether I
                have 1. had a coffee and 2. have time to make one. If both of
                these
                conditions are satisfied, i.e. I haven’t had a coffee and I do
                have time
                to make one, I enter the coffee loop and must go through all the
                steps
                listed above before moving on to other tasks.

              <h2 class="sub-heading">Describe what the DOM is and an example of
                how you might interact with
                it</h2>
              <p>
                The DOM is a tree-like representation of the web page that gets
                loaded
                into the browser. Through this structure, the user can access
                and change
                elements in a webpage. Similar to a family tree, each element
                has a
                parent element, with the exception of the starting node of the
                tree.
                Like an actual tree, interaction with the DOM allows cutting off
                branches and leaves, as well as growing new branches and leaves.
                The
                user can also modify the entire tree by changing the trunk. In
                terms of
                DOM interaction, changing the trunk would translate to editing
                the main
                parent HTML window node, for example, changing the background
                colour of
                the entire webpage.

              <h2 class="sub-heading">Explain the difference between accessing
                data from arrays and objects</h2>
              <p>
                Arrays and objects are two ways to store data in a group. In
                arrays, the
                order is the most important factor for organising information.
                This is
                similar to a fiction book that is split up between chapters
                where the
                chapters must be read in order for the story to make sense.
                However,
                objects store data according to keys or labels. This makes
                objects more
                similar to encyclopedias or nonfiction books where the reader
                will most
                likely skip to sections containing relevant information.

              <p>
                Explain what functions are and why they are helpful. Functions
                are sets
                of steps taken in order to perform a task. They are helpful in
                making
                code more concise as processes that are used multiple times can
                be laid
                out in one function and called on using simply the function
                name. This
                is similar to having a large water bottle that will last the day
                as
                opposed to a small glass that must be refilled each time I drink
                water.
