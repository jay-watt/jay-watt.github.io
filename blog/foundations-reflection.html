                <ol>
                  <li>My barrier to connecting and collaborating with others is

                    learning environment</li>

                    can improve with practice</li>
                  <li>It is very useful to explicitly write down goals and plans
                    to achieve them in order to keep myself accountable,
                    on-track and grounded</li>

              <h2 class="sub-heading">What are the role of values, empathy, and
                self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
              <p>Values, empathy and self-awareness are integral to
                interpersonal relationships whether professional or personal. If
                there is a shared willingness to
                understand each other, communication can be tailored to fit the
                individuals'
                needs. Only with effective communicating can individuals skills
                and knowledge be fully utilised to produce a superior end
                result. Ones values and levels of empathy and self-awareness
                contribute to the likelihood of understanding between two people
                with differing experience and backgrounds. In a pair
                programming, common ground may
                describe the ways collaborating that are comfortable for each
                person,
                i.e. regularity of breaks, in-person vs remote, regularity of
                switching roles, whether to have regular check-ins regarding the
                project's big picture,
                etc.

              <h2 class="sub-heading">What has surprised you the most about the
                core learning?</h2>
              <p>It surprised me how much of the core content lined up with
                knowledge and practises that were on my mind prior to EDA. The
                neuroplasticity and growth mindset section, in particular,
                pointed me in the direction of resources that I feel I have been
                unconsciously looking for for some time. Also the focus on
                reflection and journaling has been a learning style that I had
                been making efforts to incorporate into my personal routine
                before starting study at EDA.

              <h2 class="sub-heading">What were the most challenging aspects of
                the core learning?</h2>
              <p>Sharing blog posts with the cohort was very intimidating to me.
                I have felt quite anxious sharing my writing (tech and core)
                with such a large amount of people. I also found the listening
                and looping challenges easy for me to procrastinate through
                their perceived difficulty. However, after both listening and
                looping challenges, I was confident that the experiences had
                been positive and I had gained confidence from them.

              <h2 class="sub-heading">Why do you think we, a programming school,
                are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web
                development Bootcamp course?</h2>
              <p>I imagine that EDA focuses on core learning in order to give
                their students an edge and point of difference in the job
                market. Because of the benefits of working on code in pairs or
                groups, individuals with human skills are a valuable asset to
                any team that relies on collaborating. Part of the core content
                also works on making coding sustainable and enjoyable for the
                individual. EDA promotes this through putting an emphasis on
                growth and progress, rather than end products, as well as
                increasing our long-term learning potential through practicing
                reflection.

              <h2 class="sub-heading">Does the time you spent studying core
                learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just
                used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your
                answer.</h2>
              <p>The time spent on core throughout Foundations has not felt like
                a waste of time. While it took me a week or two to manage my
                stress enough to fully engage with the core content, the skills
                I have learnt will increase my longevity and effectiveness in
                programming long-term. Some of the practices I have started
                through the EDA core curriculum has also given me more tools to
                cope and grow in my personal life, the grounding from which also
                contributes to the likelihood of excelling in a professional
                programming environment. While it was easy to question the
                importance of the core content when directly comparing to the
                tech content, the indirect results of the core has given me
                access to code related knowledge I would not have had access to
                otherwise. Reaching out to peers and learning from them was made
                more accessible to me through completing core content.
