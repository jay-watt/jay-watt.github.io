      A time I was blocked on a simple problem.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A simple problem that comes up for me a lot is losing my glasses. When
      this happens, I run through several problem-solving techniques. Similar to
      writing pseudocode, I will break down my movements, since the last time I
      saw them, step-by-step. Once I have identified these steps, I can check
      each place methodically. Next, I try the rubber ducky method during which
      I talk about out loud where I would put them if I were me. It can also
      give me ideas on where to look by explaining out loud why I may have lost
      them, e.g. I had a deadline or was hungry. If I canâ€™t track them down
      after these two steps, I ask my peers, generally my flatmates, or whoever
      I am with at the time. My stress levels often increase proportionately
      with the time I spend looking. Unfortunately, this makes me less likely to
      find them as I struggle to be methodical when I am stressed. As a result,
      the last problem solving method is usually the most successful. When
      someone with fresh eyes is able to locate the glasses with ease, I am
      always reminded that the people around me are valuable resources I am able
      to learn from and that we are more capable together than apart.

    <h2>
      A time I elegantly solved a problem.
    </h2>
    <p>
      This week, one of my lamps broke. The wiring was fine, but the part that
      the lightbulb socket screws into has threading that is now too worn to
      work. This meant the bulb was hanging from the lamp but was still able to
      be turned on. I ended up attaching a rubber band from the frame to the
      socket, temporarily fixing the socket in its holder. This avoided the need
      for glue or any other materials that could permanently mark the lamp,
      while giving it full functionality. I was happy with this solution as it
      gave me the option to implement a permanent fix (i.e. getting a new part)
      in my own time, while still having the ability to use the lamp. The
      problem solving technique I used was trying something, definitely my go-to
      technique. While it is sometimes inefficient due to the inevitable process
      difficult to visualise initially. I felt engaged throughout the process
      and happy that I could be resourceful with items within arms reach. I
      learnt that it is very handy to have small multipurpose items close by in
      spaces I spend a lot of time, e.g. rubber band, paper clip, safety pin,
      etc.

          However, through much experience, I am very aware that I usually waste
          a lot of time on inefficient solutions using this method, and can get
          into a frustrated head space if I don't get to the solution quickly.

          information relating to the specific problem I am having, I can
          usually at least find resources that are related enough to help me
          gain fresh perspective on the problem.
