              </h2>
              <p>A simple problem that comes up for me a lot is losing my
                glasses. When
                this happens, I run through several problem-solving techniques.
                Similar to
                writing pseudocode, I will break down my movements, since the
                last time I
                saw them, step-by-step. Once I have identified these steps, I
                can check
                each place methodically. Next, I try the rubber ducky method
                during which
                I talk about out loud where I would put them if I were me. It
                can also
                give me ideas on where to look by explaining out loud why I may
                have lost
                them, e.g. I had a deadline or was hungry. If I canâ€™t track them
                down
                after these two steps, I ask my peers, generally my flatmates,
                or whoever
                I am with at the time. My stress levels often increase
                proportionately
                with the time I spend looking. Unfortunately, this makes me less
                likely to
                find them as I struggle to be methodical when I am stressed. As
                a result,
                the last problem solving method is usually the most successful.
                When
                someone with fresh eyes is able to locate the glasses with ease,
                I am
                always reminded that the people around me are valuable resources
                I am able
                to learn from and that we are more capable together than apart.

              <h2 class="sub-heading">A time I elegantly solved a problem.</h2>
              <p>
                This week, one of my lamps broke. The wiring was fine, but the
                part that
                the lightbulb socket screws into has threading that is now too
                worn to
                work. This meant the bulb was hanging from the lamp but was
                still able to
                be turned on. I ended up attaching a rubber band from the frame
                to the
                socket, temporarily fixing the socket in its holder. This
                avoided the need
                for glue or any other materials that could permanently mark the
                lamp,
                while giving it full functionality. I was happy with this
                solution as it
                gave me the option to implement a permanent fix (i.e. getting a
                new part)
                in my own time, while still having the ability to use the lamp.
                The
                problem solving technique I used was trying something,
                definitely my go-to
                technique. While it is sometimes inefficient due to the
                inevitable process
                difficult to visualise initially. I felt engaged throughout the
                process
                and happy that I could be resourceful with items within arms
                reach. I
                learnt that it is very handy to have small multipurpose items
                close by in
                spaces I spend a lot of time, e.g. rubber band, paper clip,
                safety pin,
                etc.

                    a lot of time on inefficient solutions using this method,
