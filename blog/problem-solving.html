              <h2 class="sub-heading">A time I was blocked on a simple problem
              </h2>
              <p>During the JS kata stretch, I got stuck on the first question
                of the JS Olympics challenge. The first question required that a
                win function was assigned to each athlete object. I could not
                figure out how to call the function as an attribute of each
                object and had not done anything similar I could
                reference.<br><br>The first problem solving method I used was
                the rubber ducky method. This was appropriate as I struggled to
                understand the concept of attaching a function to an object
                attribute. Next, in order to begin the actual code, I used
                googling. This was very effective as it was easy to find
                examples of objects with embedded functions without needing to
                read long blocks of code. The solution, unexpectedly, ended up
                being a single line long!<br><br>I felt quite frustrated before
                attempting the rubber ducky method as I didn’t feel that I could
                even get my head around the question. However, once I was able
                to articulate what it was the function needed to do, I felt much
                more calm and focussed. Once I started researching examples, I
                was happy to find the missing pieces easily. From this process,
                I learnt that before launching into pseudocode or even googling
                possible solutions, it is important for me to be confident that
                I understand exactly what the function’s set purpose is.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
              <h2 class="sub-heading">A time I elegantly solved a problem</h2>
              <p>In the Fizzbuzz challenge, I was very satisfied with the way I
                wrote and refactored the super_fizzbuzz function. This function
                had to work similarly to the previous function we were asked to
                write, however, it was to act on an array rather than an
                individual number.<br><br>To solve this problem, I began with
                writing heaps of pseudocode, paying off by giving me an
                efficient direction to tackle this problem. I didn’t end up
                needing to use any other problem solving techniques beyond
                googling the specifics of the built-in method I used, as the
                pseudocode allowed me to break the problem down enough to
                sufficiently simplify it.<br><br>I felt calm and focussed
                working on this problem and didn’t get stuck or frustrated
                throughout the solution process. It taught me that pseudocode
                really works for me in avoiding possible frustrations through
                overcomplicating the problem and wasting time on ineffective
                solutions.
