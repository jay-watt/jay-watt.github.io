              <p>
                My family has shaped my values and given me guidance in
                identifying my
                long-term fulfilling priorities. I am still learning that I have
                the
                tools and skills I need to fulfill my goals, passed down from my
                ancestors and taught to me by those whose lifetimes have
                overlapped
                with mine.

                learning journey</h2>
              <p>
                My strengths are compassion towards others and having a
                grounding
                family. This combination increases my patience towards others
                and
                gives me perspective. Additionally, my experience doing physical
                team-based work in dangerous environments has honed my effective
                communication skills.

              <p>
                I have been consistently unsuccessful in tertiary learning
                environments. While there are valid reasons, I struggle with
                self-confidence and self-belief. I think DA will challenge me to
                push
                past my imposter syndrome, particularly when it comes time to
                look for
                work. I have been most comfortable in physical jobs the past
                several
                years so I am apprehensive about fitting into an office
                environment.

              <p>
                In my time working at the Happy Valley Tip in Te
                Whanganui-a-Tara, the
                team was very diverse in terms of work and life experience. Many
                staff
                members had been there long-term from contrasting previous
                careers and
                there were often differing opinions on the most effective way to
                complete tasks. <br><br>In my time there, I focussed
                on
                listening to team members in order to assign tasks that worked
                to
                people's strengths. I also found that involving team-members in
                long-term planning to a higher degree provided bigger picture
                perspective, as well as increasing the quality of these plans
                through
                collaboration. The main thing I learnt is that while there may
                be
                difficulties in reaching a shared consensus, it is the
                differences in
                skillsets and experiences that gave the team its effectiveness
                and
                strength.
