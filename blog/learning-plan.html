                pathway?</h2>
              <p>I would like to work freelance on projects that I am invested
                in. At the moment, there are two main areas I
                would like to aim towards working in. One is sustainable waste
                management. Some apps/websites that are lacking
                in this sector focus on goals like public education, creating
                connections between people with waste and
                community members with recycling solutions, waste worker job
                assistance, etc. <br><br>The other area would be Pasifika
                knowledge access as I feel
                there is a lack of well-designed apps and websites available to
                research my culture. While the most important way
                is engaging with the elders I have around me, I
                feel strongly about there being other routes to connection,
                particularly for those in the diaspora.</p>

              <h2 class="sub-heading">A description of your strengths and
                limitations when it comes to learning</h2>
              <p>
                My major strength in learning is creative problem solving. Many
                of the skills I have and cherish today were
                learnt outside of formal learning environments and I recognise
                that valuable knowledge can often be found in
                unexpected places. I have also always enjoyed working and
                collaborating in DIY environments, and pride myself on
                being resourceful. <br><br>My biggest limitation is getting
                stuck and
                struggling to move on. It has been helpful to get
                into the habit of using a pomodoro break timer but I will need
                to keep it up long term in order to retain
                meaningful changes. Another difficulty I have is balancing my
                learning with my other obligations. <br><br>My priority,
                whether I am studying or working, is my family. They are
                consistently supportive and understanding of my
                other commitments, but I often struggle to acknowledge my
                limited capacity when I have demanding workloads
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
              <h2 class="sub-heading">What skills (non-technical core/human
                skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev
                Academy?</h2>
              <p>
                I recognise the importance of reflecting throughout project work
                and learning. I would like to practise this
                more throughout my time at DA so that I can identify the areas
                that are useful for me to reflect on. By the end
                of the course, I want to have a clear set of questions that are
                productive for me to ask myself while learning.

              <h2 class="sub-heading">A commitment to how you will manage your
                workload in this programme</h2>
              <p>
                I will take initiative in making sure I am resting and
                maintaining a healthy study-life balance. This will
                allow me to communicate more effectively, as well as increasing
                my patience when working with others. Managing
                my stress through adequate rest and therapy helps me to be a
                better listener which is, in my opinion, the most
                important part of collaborating. I will also push myself to
                reach out for help among the team at DA which will
                alleviate isolation and helplessness.

              <h2 class="sub-heading">A commitment as to how and where you will
                seek help in a timely way</h2>
              <p>
                I will make sure that I have contact details and times available
                for the appropriate DA staff throughout this
                course. Consistent therapy is something I will endeavor to keep
                up, as well as attending a support group I have
                been a part of long-term. Keeping my flatmates at home in the
                loop will also widen my network of available
                support when I need it.

                I expect to be listened to without assumptions being made, or

                shift to lunchtime for bootcamp. If not, I will fit
                it in over the weekend. Otherwise, I have no set obligations
                that will interfere with the set bootcamp schedule.
