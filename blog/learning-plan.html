                pathway?</h2>
              <p>My long term programming goals have not shifted since
                completing foundations. I would like to work towards
                projects relating to two key areas:
                sustainable waste management and Pasifika knowledge
                accessibility.
                I would prefer to work freelance on fixed-term contracts as I
                enjoy being fully committed to projects then having periods of
                rest and reflection.</p>

              <h2 class="sub-heading">What do you think your biggest strengths
                and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h2>
              <p>My biggest strengths will be my work ethic, effective
                strategies to stay focussed and on-task, and experience in
                working in a team. While I have found reaching out to peers
                intimidating throughout foundations, I have achieved the best
                results in team environments and genuinely acknowledge the
                importance of learning through collaborating. My biggest
                limitation will be the amount of energy it takes for me to
                effectively communicate with others, as I struggle with being
                present, particularly in regards to actively listening. While I
                have personal and interpersonal strategies for mitigating this,
                it is essential I get adequate time to myself in order to
                maintain self-awareness. Beyond rest, my best tool I have to
                cope with this difficulty is being honest about my weaknesses in
                order to compromise with those I am working with.

                non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h2>
              <p>A non-technical challenge I will face at bootcamp is making
                sure I am still achieving a good study life balance in order to
                stay motivated and grounded. As I havenâ€™t worked to a schedule
                as demanding as bootcamp in some time, I will need to work hard
                at interrogating my priorities and making sure I am spending my
                time outside of school wisely.

              <p>I want to continue to increase my awareness of learning styles
                and techniques that work best for me, so that I can ensure I am
                getting the most out of my time at bootcamp. This includes
                further consolidating the routine of journaling and reflecting,
                as well as maintaining a compassionate and positive mindset
                towards myself as my skills grow. I want to finish bootcamp
                feeling confident that if I am in a situation where learning
                from peers is accessible and the most effective option, I take
                the opportunity with confidence.

                Bootcamp team?</h2>
              <p>I expect useful critiques of my code and suggestions on how I
                can make it better. While I feel confident getting programs to
                work, my logic is often quite roundabout and results in messy,
                hard-to-refactor code. While passing the tests and creating a
                working program is obviously important, I want assistance and
                feedback in order to improve my habits to better utilise best
                practices. For example, I tend to use more variables than
                necessary as I often stick to arrays without considering
                objects. It is small changes like this that I want to
                incorporate long-term, in order to change the way I approach
                coding solutions.

              <p>I expect myself to stay on track with my long-term goals and
                focus on the bigger picture. This will increase my day-to-day
                motivation in order to learn as much as possible in my time at
                bootcamp. I also need to make sure I take care of my basic needs
                (sleep and diet) in order to give myself the best chance at
                utilising my time well. I am going to be accountable in regards
                to these expectations by sharing them with my core support
                network, as well as requesting that they check in with me
                regularly about whether I am meeting them.

                schedule is clear for bootcamp. I have also been careful in
                taking on any other commitments throughout bootcamp so am
                confident I do not need to have my schedule worked around.

              <p>I would like to work freelance on projects that I am invested
                in. At the moment, there are two main areas I
                would like to aim towards working in. One is sustainable waste
                management. Some apps/websites that are lacking
                in this sector focus on goals like public education, creating
                connections between people with waste and
                community members with recycling solutions, waste worker job
                assistance, etc. <br><br>The other area would be Pasifika
                knowledge access as I feel
                there is a lack of well-designed apps and websites available to
                research my culture. While the most important way
                is engaging with the elders I have around me, I
                feel strongly about there being other routes to connection,
                particularly for those in the diaspora.</p>

              <h2 class="sub-heading">A description of your strengths and
                limitations when it comes to learning</h2>
              <p>
                My major strength in learning is creative problem solving. Many
                of the skills I have and cherish today were
                learnt outside of formal learning environments and I recognise
                that valuable knowledge can often be found in
                unexpected places. I have also always enjoyed working and
                collaborating in DIY environments, and pride myself on
                being resourceful. <br><br>My biggest limitation is getting
                stuck and
                struggling to move on. It has been helpful to get
                into the habit of using a pomodoro break timer but I will need
                to keep it up long term in order to retain
                meaningful changes. Another difficulty I have is balancing my
                learning with my other obligations. <br><br>My priority,
                whether I am studying or working, is my family. They are
                consistently supportive and understanding of my
                other commitments, but I often struggle to acknowledge my
                limited capacity when I have demanding workloads

              <p>
                I recognise the importance of reflecting throughout project work
                and learning. I would like to practise this
                more throughout my time at DA so that I can identify the areas
                that are useful for me to reflect on. By the end
                of the course, I want to have a clear set of questions that are
                productive for me to ask myself while learning.

              <p>
                I will take initiative in making sure I am resting and
                maintaining a healthy study-life balance. This will
                allow me to communicate more effectively, as well as increasing
                my patience when working with others. Managing
                my stress through adequate rest and therapy helps me to be a
                better listener which is, in my opinion, the most
                important part of collaborating. I will also push myself to
                reach out for help among the team at DA which will
                alleviate isolation and helplessness.

                I will make sure that I have contact details and times available
                for the appropriate DA staff throughout this
                course. Consistent therapy is something I will endeavor to keep
                up, as well as attending a support group I have
                been a part of long-term. Keeping my flatmates at home in the
                loop will also widen my network of available
                support when I need it.
