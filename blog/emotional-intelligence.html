      <li>controlling one's own emotions</li>
      <li>perceiving how others feel</li>
      <li>using emotions to facilitate social communication</li>
      <li>relating to others</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

      <li>kKnowledge of the world</li>
      <li>fluid reasoning</li>
      <li>working memory and short-term memory</li>
      <li>quantitative reasoning</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>
      Why is it important?
    </h2>
    <p>
      IQ and EQ are both elements in a complex array of influences that play roles in overall success, as well as
      health, wellness, and happiness. Emotional abilities (e.g. empathy, initiative and self-confidence) will be the
      main factor in determine whether someone is able
      to work well in a team. EQ will also influence the choices that consumers make when confronted with buying
      decisions i.e. sales success.
