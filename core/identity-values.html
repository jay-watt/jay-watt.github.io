    <h1>Identity, Values & Strengths</h1>
    <div>
      <h2>
        Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss
        how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision
        you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
      </h2>
      <p>
        I struggled to answer this question but will update this post soon!
      </p>

      <h2>
        Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced
        your values and identity.
      </h2>
      <p>
        My family has shaped my values and given me guidance in identifying my
        long-term fulfilling priorities. I am still learning that I have the
        tools and skills I need to fulfill my goals, passed down from my
        ancestors and taught to me by those whose lifetimes have overlapped
        with mine.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>
        Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
        learning journey.
      </h2>
      <p>
        My strengths are compassion towards others and having a grounding
        family. This combination increases my patience towards others and
        gives me perspective. Additionally, my experience doing physical
        team-based work in dangerous environments has honed my effective
        communication skills.
      </p>

    <div>
      <h2>
        Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
        development. How might these affect your learning journey?
      </h2>
      <p>
        I have been consistently unsuccessful in tertiary learning
        environments. While there are valid reasons, I struggle with
        self-confidence and self-belief. I think DA will challenge me to push
        past my imposter syndrome, particularly when it comes time to look for
        work. I have been most comfortable in physical jobs the past several
        years so I am apprehensive about fitting into an office environment.

      <h2>
        Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
        others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
        tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on
        what other strategies you would try now and why.
      </h2>
      <p>
        In my time working at the Happy Valley Tip in Te Whanganui-a-Tara, the
        team was very diverse in terms of work and life experience. Many staff
        members had been there long-term from contrasting previous careers and
        there were often differing opinions on the most effective way to
        complete tasks. When I held a supervisor role there, I focussed on
        listening to team members in order to assign tasks that worked to
        people's strengths. I also found that involving team-members in
        long-term planning to a higher degree provided bigger picture
        perspective, as well as increasing the quality of these plans through
        collaboration. The main thing I learnt is that while there may be
        difficulties in reaching a shared consensus, it is the differences in
        skillsets and experiences that gave the team its effectiveness and
        strength.
